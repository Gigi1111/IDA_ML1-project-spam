# IDA_ML1-project-spam

This repo contains my final project of the Course Machine Learning and Intelligent Data Analysis at the University of Potsdam lead by Prof. T. Scheffer.

## Reproduction
As my machine wasn't powerful enough, I ran everything on Kaggle notebook, so a reproduction on there should work. But as Kaggle has limited RAM, some hyperparameter tuning results weren't able to be shown in cells as they were run in batches or in fragments so that it's runnable with limited RAM>
